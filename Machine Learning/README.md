Building audio classifier models with Tensorflow Lite using data from Tensorflow Speech Command Dataset.
We're using Mini Speech Command Dataset.
This dataset has various audio clip such as: "down", "go", "left", "no", "right", "stop", "up" and "yes".
Then we're gonna use "left", "up" and "right" as keyword for burglary('perampokan in Bahasa') and "stop" as keyford for domestic violence('Kekerasan Dalam Rumah Tangga in Bahasa')
